# Greek Fraternity Web App

### What is this app?
This app will be a pluggable web application that stores and presents fraternity family tree information.

### Who is it for?
Greek Fraternities and members who want to track, record, and visualize a part of their fraternal history.

### Why make it?
As a member of the ZX Fraternity, family trees were both a fun and important part of my fraternity experience. As a freshman it helped me more connected to the house and gave me someone who I looked up to as a mentor. I also loved the talk of our "family" history and the lore people associated with different families. I want a way to both trace the past of my family and see the future.

### How will it be used?
As this app takes form, this section will be updated so anyone that wishes to use this for their fraternity may.
